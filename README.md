# CancerPrognosis

The purpose of the project is to identify the prognosis for a future patient
if the patient has cancer. For that purpose classifiers (LDA, DLDA, QDA, G13, SEDC,
SVM, RLDA) were used.

Secondly, The accuracy of classifiers are investigated. Therefore, the
true error estimator was applied, and the dataset of 5 different dimensions (p=3, 5, 10,
40, 80) for 4 various datasets (ChenLiver, NatsoulisRats, ZhanMyeloma,
YeohLeukemia) were used.

The detailed report can be read from "Group14.pdf"

Datasets contain gene expression profiling in cancer from a
group of people, which were divided into two groups with a good (class 1) and bad
prognosis (class 0).
